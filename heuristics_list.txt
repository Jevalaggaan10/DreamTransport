Fully Computable Heuristics for Hub & Spoke Optimization

1. Passenger-Weighted Average Hops to Nearest Hub
   - Measures: Minimum number of hops (edges) from each stop to the nearest hub, weighted by passenger volume.
   - Goal: Lower values mean faster access to hubs with fewer transfers.

2. Passenger-Weighted Average Route Length
   - Measures: Total length (in hops) of each route, weighted by passenger volume.
   - Goal: Shorter, more direct routes improve efficiency and reliability.

3. Hub Load Coefficient of Variation (CV)
   - Measures: How evenly passenger loads are distributed across hubs.
     CV = (standard deviation / mean) of hub loads.
   - Goal: Lower values mean more balanced load distribution.

4. Maximum Hops in the Network
   - Measures: Longest shortest-path distance between any two connected stops.
   - Goal: Avoid overly long indirect connections in the network.

5. Directness Ratio
   - Measures: Ratio of direct trips (same route, no transfers) to all trips in the OD set.
   - Goal: Higher ratio means more direct service and fewer transfers.

6. Route Complexity
   - Measures: Average number of branching points and detours in each route,
     based on changes in direction in the network graph.
   - Goal: Lower complexity means simpler, easier-to-use routes.
